# Desktop Release Configuration

## Release Flow Summary

- Pushes to the `main` branch always run the **Release Desktop** workflow in the **dev** channel.
  - The workflow bumps the previous `desktop-dev-v*` tag by one patch, tags the current `main` commit, and builds all platforms.
  - Build outputs are published to a GitHub release with the matching tag (for example `desktop-dev-v1.2.3`).
  - A `latest.json` updater manifest is generated that references the versioned release assets and is uploaded to the channel release with the constant tag `desktop-dev`.
- Production promotions are manual (`workflow_dispatch`) runs of the same workflow.
  - Choose `environment: prod` (default) and optionally supply a `version` to promote a specific `desktop-dev-v<version>` tag; otherwise the newest dev tag is promoted.
  - Assets are published to a GitHub release tagged `desktop-v<version>` and the channel release tagged `desktop-prod` is updated with the fresh manifest.
- During each build the Tauri config is patched so the updater reads the correct channel-specific manifest:
  - Desktop dev channel → `https://github.com/samaleh2017-eng/voquill/releases/download/desktop-dev/latest.json`
  - Desktop prod channel → `https://github.com/samaleh2017-eng/voquill/releases/download/desktop-prod/latest.json`

## GitHub Release Layout

- **Versioned releases** (`desktop-dev-v*` and `desktop-v*`) contain the platform-specific updater archives, installers, and metadata for a specific build.
- **Channel releases** (`desktop-dev` and `desktop-prod`) always expose the latest manifest for that track (`latest.json`). The manifest points back to the correct versioned assets, so the updater downloads the exact build produced in the corresponding workflow run.
- Tags `desktop-dev` and `desktop-prod` are moved forward on each publish so they always reference the commit that produced the release.

No additional storage credentials are required—the workflow publishes directly to GitHub releases using the provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## macOS Signing & Permissions

- The desktop bundle enables Hardened Runtime with custom entitlements at `apps/desktop/src-tauri/macos/Voquill.entitlements`. Keep the Developer ID certificate in sync with these capabilities if you adjust microphone or keyboard monitoring features.
- macOS now prompts for microphone access (`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`) and accessibility (`NSAccessibilityUsageDescription`) the first time the app runs. These strings live in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Info.plist`.

## Windows Installer & VC++ Runtime DLLs

- Both NSIS and MSI installers bundle Visual C++ 2015-2022 Runtime DLLs via Tauri's `bundle.resources`.
- These DLLs are required because native dependencies (whisper-rs, cpal, rdev) link against the MSVC runtime.
- During CI, the workflow copies `msvcp140.dll`, `vcruntime140.dll`, and `vcruntime140_1.dll` from the runner's System32 to `src-tauri/` and patches `tauri.conf.json` to include them in resources.
- This uses Tauri's official supported method for bundling additional files.

## Verifying a Dev Release

1. Push to `main` and wait for the **Release Desktop** workflow to finish.
2. Check the `metadata` job output for the new `desktop-dev-v*` tag.
3. Inspect the GitHub release for that tag to confirm platform bundles and metadata uploaded successfully.
4. Confirm the dev manifest is accessible at `https://github.com/samaleh2017-eng/voquill/releases/download/desktop-dev/latest.json`.
5. Launch the dev desktop app; the updater should point at the dev manifest URL injected during CI.

## Dev → Prod Promotion Checklist

1. Optionally verify that the desired dev tag exists (`git tag -l 'desktop-dev-v*' --sort=-v:refname`).
2. Trigger the **Release Desktop** workflow manually:
   - Leave `version` blank to promote the most recent dev tag, or set it to an explicit `x.y.z`.
   - Ensure `environment` is `prod`.
3. Inspect the `desktop-v<version>` GitHub release to validate the uploaded assets.
4. Confirm the production manifest: `https://github.com/samaleh2017-eng/voquill/releases/download/desktop-prod/latest.json`.
